## Motivation

Game server moderation is a hard task. Most moderators are volunteers who contribute their time to keep their respective communities in good shape to provide fun for their players.

Moderators have a tricky task because it often involves keeping an eye on — in many cases — dozens of players while still trying to enjoy the game themselves.

Many moderators work as part of a larger team where communication is key in order to keep rulings consistent between different moderators. Often times, this is done in a group chat or a rudimentary logging system. This can work, but it's not perfect as it becomes difficult for moderators to quickly find a player's history and other key information in the very fast paced environment of online game servers.

With Refractor, all this information is centralized and easy to find with the help of a modern user interface. With Refractor, quickly finding relevant data for player interactions is easy so that moderators can moderate more effectively while still enjoying the game.
